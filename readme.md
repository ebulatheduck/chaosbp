# ChaosBP

A behavior pack for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that adds a bit of chaos to your world.

## How to use

- Run `/function start` to begin the chaos.
- Run `/function stop` to get a break from the chaos.
- Use the `chaos:config` item to configure the duration between chaos activations.
- Give yourself the tag `nochaos` to be exempt from chaos functions.
